# Switch to the branch you want to merge INTO (usually main)
git checkout main

# Pull the latest changes to make sure you're up to date
git pull origin main

# Merge your feature branch into main
git merge feature/smp-multicore-support

# Push the merged changes to GitHub
git push origin main


If there are conflicts, Git will tell you which files have conflicts. You'll need to:

Open the conflicting files
Manually resolve the conflicts (Git marks them with <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>)
Stage the resolved files with git add
Complete the merge with git commit

For contributing to someone else's project (like osfree), you'd use method #1 (pull request) since you likely don't have direct write access to their repository.
